# Step by Step
> Challenge for today : refactor the `TripService` class to ensure Clean Code / SOLID principles

Legacy code golden rules :
`You cannot change any existing code if not covered by tests.`

The only exception is if we need to change the code to add unit tests, but in this case, just automated refactorings (via IDE) are allowed.

## Tips
- Start testing from shortest to deepest branch
- Start refactoring from deepest to shortest branch

## My "solution"
1 solution folder per step:
1. [Cover the production code](steps/1.cover-the-code.md)
2. [Improve confidence in our tests](steps/2.mutate-some-code.md)
3. [Refactor the production code](steps/3.refactoring.md)
4. [Other refactorings](steps/4.other-refactorings.md)

## What did we use / learn ?
- Seams
- Automated refactoring via our IDE
  - Extract Method
  - Change Signature
  - Rename
- Use `Higher Order Functions` to avoid duplication
- Use code coverage as a driver
- Test Data Builder
- Feature Envy
- Intro to TDD
