## Surface refactoring
Make some clean up and renames :
- Remove `TripServiceBackup` class
- Rename `getTripsByUser` into `getFriendTrips` for example
- Use `Seq` everywhere
- Remove usage of `MutableList` in `User`
```scala
class User(val trips: Seq[Trip], val friends: Seq[User]) {
  def addFriend(user: User): User =
    new User(trips, user +: friends)

  def addTrip(trip: Trip) =
    new User(trip +: trips, friends)

  def isFriendWith(anotherUser: User): Boolean =
    friends.contains(anotherUser)
}
```
- What is the impact on our tests ?
  - `None` thanks to the usage of our `UserBuilder`
  - We just have to adapt it
```scala
class UserBuilder {
  private var friends: Seq[User] = Seq.empty
  private var trips: Seq[Trip] = Seq.empty

  def friendsWith(friends: User*): UserBuilder =
    assign(_ => this.friends = friends)

  def travelledTo(trips: Trip*): UserBuilder =
    assign(_ => this.trips = trips)

  def build(): User = new User(trips, friends)

  private def assign(func: Any => Unit): UserBuilder = {
    func()
    this
  }
}

object UserBuilder {
  def aUser(): UserBuilder = new UserBuilder
}
```
